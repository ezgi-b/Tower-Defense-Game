\f0\fs24 \cf2 Your job is to defend the treasure chest from\cf0  \cf2 the enemies that follow a specific path. Click a spot on the screen to\cf0  \cf2 spawn a tower. There are two types of towers: \'93shooty\'94 and \'93firey\'94 ones. A popup will appear. Type in the name of the tower (either \'93shooty or \'93firey\'94) you wish to buy to buy it. Shooty towers shoot projectiles at the enemies that take away 2 health from them. Firey towers set the enemies on fire, and any projectile from a shooty tower will do double the damage. You can upgrade shooty towers by pressing the 'u' key then specifying which number tower you wish to upgrade. Shooty towers cost $20, then each upgrade is $20 more, and you can only upgrade twice. Firey towers cost $40, and you can\'92t upgrade them. The more towers you have, the quicker the enemies speed up. To slow them down, press the \'93s\'94 key and it takes away $15 and slows the spawn rate of the enemies. The more enemies you kill, the higher your final score will be.}
